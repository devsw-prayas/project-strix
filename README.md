# Project Documentation: Secure Financial Transactions with Decentralized Anti-Tamper DAG

---

## 1. Problem Statement
Financial systems today face two major challenges:

1. **Security & Tamper Resistance**: Centralized databases make transactions vulnerable to manipulation, fraud, or insider threats.  
2. **Performance**: Blockchain-based systems ensure security but are often too slow for real-time trading or payments.  

We aim to build an **extremely fast, tamper-resistant financial transaction system** using a **local + global DAG structure** for anti-tamper verification, orchestrated by a **high-performance backend in Go**.  

This system will power:  
- Secure money transfers between accounts.  
- Buying and selling of stocks/assets.  
- Near-instant fraud detection via anti-tamper DAG consensus.

## 2. Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)  
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS  
- **Routing**: Next.js file-based routing  
- **State/Data Management**: Apollo GraphQL Client / urql  
- **Animations**: Tailwind transitions + keyframes  

### Backend
- **Language**: Go (for HPC and concurrency)  
- **GraphQL Orchestration**: gqlgen (Go GraphQL server)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (transaction ledger)  
- **Anti-Tamper DAG Layer**:  
  - Local DAG = node-level transaction graph  
  - Global DAG = cross-node tamper detection + consensus  

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker (modular nodes, scalable horizontally)  
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose / Kubernetes (stretch goal)  
- **Deployment**: Cloud (Vercel for frontend, AWS/GCP for backend)

## 3. Core Innovations

### Anti-Tamper DAG Security
- Each transaction creates a node in a **local DAG**.  
- Local DAGs sync into a **global DAG** across multiple servers.  
- If one node/server is compromised, inconsistencies are quickly flagged in the global DAG.  
- **Tamper = instant detection** → unmatched security compared to centralized DBs.  

### Blistering Performance with Go
- Go’s concurrency (goroutines + channels) allows **thousands of transactions/second**.  
- Low-latency message passing ensures real-time updates for clients.  

### Frontend Experience
- A **banking-style dashboard** with account balances, transfers, and activity logs.  
- Real-time updates via **GraphQL subscriptions**.  
- Clean, modern UI powered by **pure Tailwind**.

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 – Core Setup
- Next.js frontend with Tailwind skeleton (dashboard, login, transfer page).  
- Go backend with GraphQL API (basic CRUD for accounts + transactions).  
- PostgreSQL database schema for accounts & ledger.  

### Phase 2 – DAG Security Layer
- Implement **Local DAG** for each node.  
- Sync mechanism to build a **Global DAG**.  
- Anti-tamper detection logic (conflict resolution + alerts).  

### Phase 3 – Advanced Features
- Real-time GraphQL subscriptions for live transaction updates.  
- Fraud/tamper visualization in **admin dashboard**.  
- Dockerized deployment (local nodes + sync).  

---

## 5. Deliverables for Hackathon
- **Frontend**: Beautiful “fake bank” UI (accounts, transfers, stock buying/selling).  
- **Backend**: Go GraphQL API with working DAG anti-tamper system.  
- **Deployment**: Dockerized nodes running locally, frontend on Vercel.  
- **Demo**: Show a transaction being tampered → caught by DAG instantly.

## Decentralized Anti-Tamper Tech (BlockDAG + TPM)

### Core Idea
**Problem**: In traditional systems, tampering with a single server or DB copy can alter critical account states.  

**Solution**:  
- **BlockDAG Layer**: Each transaction/state change is stored in a **local DAG** (per institution or node cluster). Local DAGs sync to a **global DAG** distributed across multiple servers.  
- **TPM Integration**: Each participating node uses **Trusted Platform Module** to verify:  
  - Integrity of its OS / runtime environment.  
  - Cryptographic identity (signatures bound to hardware).  

**Result**: Even if one node is compromised:  
- Tampered data fails validation because other DAG replicas + TPM attestation reject it.  
- Malicious node gets quarantined automatically.
